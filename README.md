# PUTMAN ToneSigâ„¢ Responder (Prototype)

This is a working proof-of-concept for a symbolic tone classification and response demo, based on the PUTMAN Model and Tone Vector System (TVSâ„¢).  
It simulates emotional tone recursion across a 5-turn scripted sequence, followed by a live conversation mode using ToneSigâ„¢ inputs.

## Features

- ðŸŽ­ Symbolic response system mapped to ToneSig codes like `Â¡13.83`
- ðŸ”„ Recursive emotional memory across user turns
- ðŸ§  D-Field classification: D1â€“D4 (based on PUTMAN symbolic awareness states)
- ðŸ“Š Tone Memory Trail showing symbolic trace of user interaction

## Run the Demo

```bash
cd tonesig_responder
python3 -m tonesig_responder.main
